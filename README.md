# Hacking-scripts

Just a place for all those cool scripts I have found or made that have come in use.
There are one(-ish*)-liners and concept files per language.
I trying to refactor for each language as and when I need to, therefore if am not using it I am not refactoring to it or writing from scratch or finding scripts.
I separated one-liner out from my own cheatsheets for the purpose of archiving and more importantly finding, remembering and using them more
