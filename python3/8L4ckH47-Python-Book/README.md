# 8l4ckH47 Python 

These script are refactored versions with as much extra feature creep as I can add. I bought the book, the pdf on a charity bundle. Go buy it, support the authors. I learnt alot of python from this book and it got me through a tough period, thanks book and authors. I handcoded it myself because I would recommend you do that.

[EONRaider has a more updated version of the very deprecated use of some of the library involved](https://github.com/EONRaider/blackhat-python3) - this section of the repository is more for me to atleast debug my own problems than for real use - like transpiling it to other languages for speed and personal development. 

Long story short: Buy book, go else where probably

# tcpServer

python3 with f strings
